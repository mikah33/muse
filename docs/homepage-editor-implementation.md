- **Fields:**
  - `section_number` ('01' through '05')
  - `icon` (emoji like 📸, 💼, etc.)
  - `title` (section heading)
  - `description` (section intro paragraph)
  - `items` (array of service details - JSONB)
  - `display_order` (for drag-and-drop reordering)

- ✅ Change icons, titles, descriptions
- ✅ Add, edit, or remove service items

### 3. Frontend Integration
